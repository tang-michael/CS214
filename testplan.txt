We initially ran basic tests using various unsorted strings and integers to make sure that the program was functional. 
Then, we began adding things to our tests that may cause the program problems like white spaces, blank tokens, and new lines.
Finally, we began testing for warnings and errors using blank files and incorrect command line arguments.
